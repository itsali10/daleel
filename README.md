# Daleel Application Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a modern web platform that provides complete guidance on how and where to obtain government documentation in Egypt, such as ID cards, passports, birth certificates, licenses, and more.
The website offers detailed, verified, and continuously updated instructions on each process — including required documents, steps, fees, and official locations.

Users must create an account and subscribe to gain access to the platform.
Only paid subscribers can view the documentation, guides, and step-by-step procedures.
The platform’s goal is to make dealing with government paperwork simpler, faster, and more reliable, eliminating confusion and wasted time.

Core Problems Addressed:

Scattered and outdated information about government procedures.

Difficulty identifying correct steps, fees, and required forms.

Frequent wasted visits due to missing or incorrect documents.

No centralized, verified source for all documentation needs.

Lack of transparency and clarity in official processes.
